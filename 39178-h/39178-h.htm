<p class="bqnohang"><i>A bare chamber lighted by a penny dip which casts shadows. On a hard
chair by a table sits an</i> <span class="smcap">Emperor</span> <i>in thought</i>. <i>To him come his</i>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>Indicating a paper in the</i> <span class="smcap">Chancellor's</span> <i>hand</i>.)</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> (<i>presenting it</i>). It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's
signature.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be
at war with France and Russia.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> At last, this little paper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal
signature. The&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will
not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown
since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's Germany,
when I have signed! And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor</span> (<i>flashing</i>). Afraid!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>abject</i>). Oh, Sire!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me
every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand nightingales!
I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the
spire of Strassburg Cathedral."</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have
made us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his
deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword
must speak.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor</span> (<i>approvingly</i>). There the sword spoke&mdash;and yet the wise one
said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal go
to them instead of to you." One at a time. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>) Why am I
not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's friend
until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire,
your signature!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> What of Britain?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>intently</i>). This&mdash;The Day, to which we have so often drunk,
draws near!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> The Day! To The Day! (<i>All salute The Day with their swords.</i>)
But when?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Now, if she wants it!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> There is no road to Britain&mdash;until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> our neighbors are subdued.
Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> (<i>suavely</i>). Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in
just now.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> If I was sure of that!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her
at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to
turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with
the civic powers.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It
is a land that in the past has done things.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies
Britain's greatness.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and
sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her such
as keep powers alive&mdash;and timid, too&mdash;without red blood in her, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> in
its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is her own
safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed again.
Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small
excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags."
That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret
compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not
at present need we will not at present take.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an
infamous proposal.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know
them, Sire. Your signature?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor</span> (<i>gleaming</i>). I can fling a million men within the week across
the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>with a frown</i>). There are a hundred gates to open that way.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> My guns shall open them.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>with meaning</i>). You can think of no easier road, Sire?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I think of it night and day.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> One further north&mdash;through Belgium?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>misunderstanding</i>). On the contrary, Sire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against&mdash;by honor,
by my plighted word.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Yet, Sire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor</span> (<i>after hesitating</i>). No, no! I will not so stain my name.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with
France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have
private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage
France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such
dastard words.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> France will hack her way through her.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to
sign?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> Bonaparte would have acted quickly.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Bonaparte!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> The paper, Sire.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it
signed.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>warningly</i>). The least delay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> Overmuch reflection&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I wish to be alone.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>They retire respectfully, but anxious. He is left alone in
thought.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only
at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany, but
not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte,
coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks&mdash;say four,
to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with
Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we reach&mdash;The
Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we embark, and
cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into our hands,
the British fleet destroyed&mdash;for that is part of the plan&mdash;Dover to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
London is a week of leisured marching, and London itself, unfortified
and panic-stricken, falls in a day! <i>Væ victis!</i> I'll leave conquered
Britain some balls to play with, so that there shall be no uprising.
Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists, for now I
strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel it's as good as done
before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the world! And all for pacific
ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come at last to the great
desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all! God in the heavens, I
upon the earth&mdash;we two! (<i>Raising his brows threateningly</i>) <i>And there
are still the Zeppelins!</i> I'll sign!</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>He sits in thought. He is very tired, and soon he is asleep. The
lighting becomes strange; he dreams, and we see his dream. The</i>
<span class="smcap">Spirit of Culture</span> <i>appears, a noble female figure in white robes</i>.)</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Who's that?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed
over happy Germany.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor</span> (<i>who gives her royal honor</i>). A friend&mdash;a consort! I would hear
you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you
were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at times,
as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one, but as
Kings go you have been a worthy King.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> It was all done for you.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden
granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and furnaces,
its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of
learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they were
dedicate to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor, and
now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have robed
me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> You would not have me sign?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a
looking-glass too long.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your
banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your
weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I have
many homes, and the fairest is in France.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> If that were true, Germany would care less for you.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no
single nation's servant, no single race's Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> I am not of German
make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your
heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you
say you fight for me. Find some other reason.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> The jealousies of nations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root
of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others
want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them? Bites
out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry: "The blood
be on their heads; they force me into war."</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from
on high.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine
for war the world has forged.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a
Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> France invades little Belgium.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you
at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great
opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down.
Beware of Belgium!</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>She goes. He is left in two minds. He crosses to sign. He flings
down the pen. He strikes the bell.</i> <span class="smcap">Chancellor</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Officer</span>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> Your Imperial Majesty has signed?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> You were the friend of Austria.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on
every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her
terms.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chancellor.</span> Nay, Sire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> And so, there will be no war.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Sire, we beg&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> These are my commands.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>They have to go, chagrined, but deferential.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That
be my zenith!</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>He goes back to the chair; he sleeps peacefully; in the distance a

if even your dreams appal you.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>He wakes, and for a moment he scarcely understands that he has

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> You! You have come here to mock me!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> Oh, no.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I
forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it was
before the war.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> It was you who made the war, O Emperor!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Emperor</span> (<i>huskily</i>). Belgium?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests
a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span class="smcap">Emperor.</span> I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Culture.</span> It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid
waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of
war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
